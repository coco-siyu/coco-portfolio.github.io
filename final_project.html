            <h2>High-Level Summary</h2>
            <p>This project aims to spotlight the growing wildfire crisis in the United States by leveraging data visualization to uncover patterns, causes, and impacts of wildfires. Each year, approximately <strong>70,000 wildfires</strong> occur across the U.S., burning an average of <strong>7 million acres</strong> and causing billions in damages, including destruction to homes, forests, and infrastructure. The goal of this project is to highlight the connection between increasing wildfire frequency and factors such as climate change, human activity, and deforestation, emphasizing the urgent need for better prevention and mitigation efforts.</p>
            <p>Through a combination of maps, time-series charts, and impact assessments, this visualization will offer a clear, accessible look at how wildfires are affecting different regions of the U.S. The project will also show how these fires contribute to long-term environmental damage, air quality decline, and economic losses. By making the data visually compelling, the project seeks to drive awareness and motivate action to address this escalating issue.</p>

            <h2>Project Structure</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        The story opens by framing wildfires as an escalating environmental crisis. A brief overview presents the key statistics (e.g., annual wildfire occurrences, acres burned, economic impact).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Causes and Contributing Factors</h3>
                    <p>
                        This section delves into the causes behind the rising wildfire numbers. Data will show how climate change, deforestation, and human activities (e.g., fire negligence, industrial actions) contribute to the issue.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Geographical Impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        Maps highlight the U.S. regions most affected by wildfires, with a focus on the West Coast, where drought and heatwaves have amplified fire intensity and frequency. The goal here is to visualize wildfire hotspots and how theyâ€™ve shifted or intensified over time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Economic and Environmental Consequences</h3>
                    <p>
                        Visuals depict the staggering costs of wildfires, including property damage, forest loss, and recovery efforts. Another visual will focus on CO2 emissions, showing the environmental impact wildfires have on contributing to global warming.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Call to Action</h3>
                    <p>
                        The final section motivates viewers to support wildfire prevention efforts, stay informed about local fire risks, and advocate for stronger climate policies. It will close with a personal appeal for individual and collective action.

            <h2>The Data</h2>
            <p>This project will utilize several public datasets, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) - Fire Perimeters and Incident Data:</strong> Contains detailed information on wildfire incidents in California, including the cause of the fire (arson, equipment use, campfires, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>California Fire Perimeters (all):</strong> The dataset contains valuable information about wildfire incidents in California, including the fire's start and containment dates, causes, and size.
                    <!-- <strong>National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC):</strong> Historical data on wildfire occurrences, acres burned, and suppression costs. -->
                </li>
                <!-- <li><strong>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):</strong> Data on air quality and CO2 emissions related to wildfires.</li> -->
            </ul>
            <p>
                The dataset under consideration provides detailed information on wildfires that have occurred in California, 
                listing various attributes such as fire name, location, start and containment dates, causes, and the size of the fires. 
                Analyzing these factors can help identify patterns and trends that may assist in understanding how wildfires spread, 
                their causes, and their impact on both natural resources and human activity.
                With wildfires becoming increasingly common due to climate change, it is vital to explore their causes and effects on ecosystems, air quality, and economic infrastructure. 
                The data will be preprocessed for consistency and will be displayed in a clear, intuitive format to communicate key findings effectively.
                By leveraging data from the dataset, this project aims to bring attention to the significant role that human and natural activities play in wildfire occurrences, 
                while also assessing the scale of damage caused by these fires in terms of both geographic spread and containment efforts.
