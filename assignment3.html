    <h1>Data Visualization Redesign Process</h1>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step One: The Visualization</h2>
        
            I found this dataset very interesting as I am a dog person and used to have a dog. This visualization presents many interesting facts regarding dogs in NYC and the overall design is fun and witty. 
            Hence, the design and the context caught my attention. At the same time, I also noticed that there are certain things could be adjusted such as the chart type, color usage, title naming, axis labeling, etc.

            <p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step Two: The Critique</h2>
        <h3>Design 1</h3>
    <h4>Strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The use of <strong>dog breed pictures</strong> to represent each breed was a standout feature. It immediately grabbed attention and made the graph more visually engaging.</li>
        <li>The <strong>color palette</strong> complemented the design well, blending harmoniously with the images of the dog breeds.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>fonts and colors</strong> of the information at the bottom were unclear and needed improvement for better readability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design 2</h3>
    <h4>Strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>bold title</strong> clearly conveyed the graph's purpose and was the first element to catch the eye.</li>
        <li>The font was <strong>easy to read</strong>, and the use of dog breed images made the visualization visually appealing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The design felt a bit <strong>cluttered</strong> due to the large number of breeds (20 in total), which spread the scale too broadly.</li>
        <li>Some elements, like the <strong>blue dots</strong>, lacked annotations, making them confusing to interpret.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design 3</h3>
    <h4>Strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>bright green background</strong> and <strong>central Labrador breed in motion</strong> were visually prominent, drawing attention immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Annotations</strong> were useful in providing context, such as the data source.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>sprint line</strong> on the right side didn’t relate meaningfully to the breeds and could mislead the audience.</li>
        <li>The <strong>background image</strong> was somewhat distracting, making the data harder to focus on. A bar chart might better represent the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design 4</h3>
    <h4>Strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>bone-shaped name tags</strong> were a cute, unique, and eye-catching design element.</li>
        <li>The <strong>size of the tags</strong> was well-ordered, making it easy to follow the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>font color</strong> for the number of dogs beneath the tags needed improvement. Using black to contrast with the brown background would make it more readable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overall Strengths</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual appeal</strong>: The use of images and unique shapes (like the bone tags) made the visualizations engaging and fun, which works well for the intended audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear focus</strong>: The titles and focal points, like dog breed images, helped guide the viewer's attention to the important aspects of each visualization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Overall Weaknesses</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clutter</strong>: In some designs, like Design 2, having too many elements created a cluttered appearance that made it harder to interpret the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Color and accessibility issues</strong>: The use of red and green could cause issues for colorblind users. A more neutral or accessible color palette would be beneficial.</li>
        <li><strong>Annotations and labels</strong>: Some graphs lacked proper annotations (e.g., Design 2’s blue dots), making it hard to understand all the elements. Legends or clearer labeling would improve comprehension.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step Three: Sketch a Solution</h2>
        <p>As the author has 6 designs, I chose 4 of them to redesign based on my critique above.</p>
        <div class="screenshot">
            <img src="./images/assignment3/map-redesign1.jpg" alt="Sketch of Redesign" width="100%">
            <img src="./images/assignment3/popular-breeds.jpeg" alt="Sketch of Redesign" width="100%">

            <img src="./images/assignment3/top5-breed.jpeg" alt="Sketch of Redesign" width="100%">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <h2>Step Four: Test the Solution</h2>
        <p>In this step, I presented the redesigned sketch to 2 people and collected feedback from them by asking questions listed below. By doing so, I am able to see from other perspectives and likely gain some valuable inputs.</p>
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>Can you tell me what you think this is?</li>
            <li>Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</li>
            <li>Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</li>
            <li>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</li>
            <li>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</li>
        </ul> -->

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Question</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>For this graphic, what do you see first?</td>
                    <td>For the density map, the green shades and the circle plots caught my eye. There are also red dots spread out over the green map, with different sizes that probably representing different data values.</td>
                    <td>I see the map first, and then the table for like the greens for dog spread and brown as dog bites.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</td>
                    <td>The graph is telling the relationship between the dog distribution and the cases of dog bites in NYC. The darker the green dot is, the denser of the dog distribution. The darker the red color is, the larger the number of cases of dog bites in that area.</td>
                    <td>It's telling me that there are like a lot of dogs and also many dog bites.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Is there anything you found confusing?</td>
                    <td>There isn’t a very obvious correlation of the two variables detected from this graph, which makes me look forward to the real visualization given the more intensive real data. </td>
                    <td>Not a clear relationship yet and the color usage right now could be changed.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</td>
                    <td>Social worker, policymaker, pet hospital, dog owner, general public</td>
                    <td>The intended audience for this could be like animal helping department of the city council or something like that. So, like, remind people that we need more dog bites everywhere</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</td>
                    <td>I’m not sure if I’m correct, but green and red can be challenging to use together in data visualization because they can cause problems for people with color blindness. Consider using blue as the background and a darker color for the dots.</td>
                    <td>I'll probably change the color of the the indications. Like for dog, use something more neutral instead of like green cause green always means like correct and red always means like wrong. So use a different color for for the dogs and then another color for dog bites. Maybe you can do like a icon or something. Um, that helps.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Synthesis</h3>
        <p>
            Suggested Improvements:
            Change the Color Scheme: Address the accessibility issue with the green and red colors, considering colorblind-friendly palettes. Switching to more neutral or contrasting colors (e.g., blue and darker shades) was a common recommendation.
            Icons and Symbols: Use symbols, like paw prints for dog distribution and bite marks for dog bites, to make the representation more intuitive.
            Refining the Message: Since the correlation between the two variables was not immediately clear, adding additional context or improving how the data relationship is visualized (e.g., through tooltips or labeling) could help.
            Influence on the Final Redesign:
            Based on the feedback, the redesign will focus on:
            
            Improving Accessibility: Redesigning the color palette to be more accessible for users with color blindness and avoiding traditional color associations (green for correct, red for wrong).
            Using Symbols: Incorporating visual symbols like icons to distinguish between different data points more clearly, ensuring the audience quickly understands what each plot represents.
            Enhancing Clarity: Adding visual aids or annotations that more explicitly show the relationship between dog distribution and dog bite cases to improve the graph's interpretability.        </p>

        <h2>Step Five: Build the Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the feedback from the interview inclass and outside class, I decided to change rephrase the title and add the year. Also change the green color to blue due to colorblind-friendly consideration.
