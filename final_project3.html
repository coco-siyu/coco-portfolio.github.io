                <p>
                    Significant changes were made to the final project after Part II, including adjustments to the color palette, call-to-action content, and data visualization formatting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The color scheme was notably revised throughout the entire presentation. 
                    Eashwari provided valuable feedback regarding the color palette's inconsistency with the cover slide. 
                    In response, I opted for a dark background color, complemented by a suitable font color. 
                    Previously, the palette was quite basic, mainly using blue and white, which didn't align well with the main topic. 
                    I revised it to incorporate dark blue, red, and some green and white towards the end for the call-to-action section. 
                    This shift helps evoke the emotions intended for each narrative stage—highlighting devastating wildfire statistics, 
                    illustrating the causes and impacts, and concluding with a hopeful call for action.
     
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the call-to-action section, I implemented feedback suggesting that I break down the guidelines into three grids 
                    instead of a long list. This layout creates a cleaner and more organized look, reducing eye movement and enhancing user engagement. 
                    I also incorporated credible sources like the National Park Service and California State Parks to provide reliable information on responsible behaviors 
                    during activities like camping and debris burning.    
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Additionally, I refined the visualizations by removing unnecessary data markers, improving clarity and focus.

                <p>
                    Finally, I ensured that all sources and references were clearly listed, and I made necessary grammar improvements throughout.

                    This project was both enjoyable and informative for me. I’m glad I chose a topic that aligns with my passion for nature and being close to forests. 
                    In fact, I'm about to head to Virginia for fall break to hike in Shenandoah, so it feels meaningful to reflect on the importance of preserving forests—even though this project focused on California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also appreciated the chance to develop and apply new skills in Tableau and Shorthand. 
                    To improve my visualizations, I taught myself some additional design techniques on Tableau. 
                    Shorthand's design tools helped me think carefully about presentation—considering whether each headline is intuitive, if the images enhance the topic, and which color schemes and fonts best support the content.

                    Looking back, if I had more time, I’d expand my analysis to cover the United States as a whole. 
                    While California is particularly prone to wildfires and has abundant data, it would be valuable to explore a more comprehensive dataset for the entire country. 
                    This would allow for deeper analysis and broader comparisons, offering insights beyond a single state’s wildfire records.
