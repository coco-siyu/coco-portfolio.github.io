            <ol>
                    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                    <p>
                        My audience for this project could be categorized in 3 groups: Avid Hiking Enthusiasts, California Residents, and Environmentally Conscious Individuals.
                    </p>
                <li>
                    <h3>Avid Hiking Enthusiasts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hiking enthusiasts are deeply connected to California’s stunning landscapes, from the towering redwoods to the expansive national parks. 
                        The growing wildfire crisis poses a direct threat to the trails and natural beauty they cherish. 
                        By highlighting the risks that wildfires pose to their favorite hiking spots, this project can educate hikers on the importance of wildfire prevention and awareness. 
                        Encouraging them to stay informed about local fire risks and support conservation efforts aligns with their love for the outdoors.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>California Residents</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the most wildfire-prone state in the U.S., California residents are living on the frontlines of the wildfire crisis. 
                        Whether they are directly impacted by evacuations or dealing with smoke-filled skies, this audience knows firsthand the devastation wildfires bring. 
                        The project aims to inform residents about the causes, economic costs, and environmental damage of wildfires in their state, 
                        motivating them to take preventative actions, advocate for stronger climate policies, and protect their communities.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Environmentally Conscious Individuals</h3>
                    <p>
                        People who care about climate change and environmental sustainability are key allies in the fight against wildfires. 
                        For this group, the connection between rising wildfire occurrences and broader environmental issues like global warming is particularly compelling. 
                        Through data visualizations that show the impact of wildfires on forests, air quality, and wildlife, this project appeals to their commitment to preserving the planet. 
                        They are likely to support long-term solutions, such as reforestation and climate legislation, that mitigate wildfire risks.

            <h2>Identifying Interview Representatives</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, I chose three interviewees who represent the key demographics I am targeting: a California resident, a hiking enthusiast, and one environmental advocate. 
                These individuals reflect the diversity of people who are most affected by wildfires and who care deeply about the issue.

                            The visuals clearly show how serious wildfires are becoming, especially in California. 
                            I found the maps highlighting affected areas really powerful.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The charts on fire frequency over time are alarming. 
                            It made me realize how quickly things are getting worse in areas where I love to hike.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The data on CO2 emissions from wildfires was eye-opening. 
                            It tied together the issue of wildfires with broader environmental degradation.

                            Yes, I’m now more aware of the urgency to push for better fire prevention policies in my community.                        
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            Definitely. It made me think about how I can be more conscious of fire risks when hiking and how I can spread awareness to fellow hikers.                        
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            I think it’s crucial to act, not just on local fire prevention, 
                            but on broader climate policies that tackle wildfire causes like climate change.

                            The visuals made it feel real.                        </td>
                        <td>
                            Yes, the narrative linking wildfires to climate change was effective. 
                            I think it could go even deeper into the long-term environmental consequences.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The story made me think about how my favorite outdoor spots could be affected. 
                            It was engaging, especially when talking about specific trails that are at risk.

                        <td>
                            I think adding more personal stories from residents impacted by wildfires would make the call to action even more compelling. 
                            The data was strong, but a human element might drive the message home.                        
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            I loved the emphasis on individual responsibility when it comes to fire safety while hiking, 
                            but maybe there could be more practical steps on how hikers can get involved in local fire prevention initiatives.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The call to action was strong, especially when focused on larger climate policies. 
                            However, I think it could benefit from more specifics on how to advocate—like providing links to organizations or petitions.

                        <li>
                            Pattern: While the interviewees understood the main conflict (wildfire risks), they felt that adding personal stories would strengthen the emotional impact.

                        <li>
                            Change: I will incorporate personal anecdotes from individuals directly affected by wildfires. This will make the conflict more relatable and compelling, helping to emotionally engage the audience and emphasize the urgency of wildfire prevention.

For hikers, I’ll include steps like "Join a fire prevention group" or "Follow fire safety guidelines on trails." For environmentally conscious individuals, I’ll provide links to advocacy organizations and petitions to encourage immediate action.
